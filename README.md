Group Project:

Started as a remedy for indecisive couples’ entertainment, this application can really be used by anyone who doesn’t want to deal with making choices about food and flick combinations!

Eat dis Watch dat selects a restaurant and movie combination that is sure to satisfy both parties.
The food and show combo is initially determined by the user’s location. 

Once the user logs in, his or her preferences are stored and used in subsequent attempts to match future movies and restaurants.

*This app is still is the development stage and currently only selects restaurants and theaters based on the user’s immediate location, but the zip code function will soon be available—along with admin and reporter features.
